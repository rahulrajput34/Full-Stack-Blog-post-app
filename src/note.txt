<!-- 
 What we gonna learn in this lecture??
 - first we created environment varibales in this project
 - In this environment varibales we have unique ids and user password and all there are many ways to access this password and ids by just using JavaScript
 - TO protect our data we make system varibale in .env file (we must create this inside the root means in src like index.html and README.md)
 - Secondly we have creared .env.sample 
 - Them we move on the Appwriter
 - We wrote all our own code for appwrite in one  folder and fronend do not know about anything. From this if we want change our code in the future we just need to changge to code in this one directory  of  the auth only
 - we can also copy paste the code if we want to write our code in the appwrite backend and add some methods as wll inside the auth
 -->
